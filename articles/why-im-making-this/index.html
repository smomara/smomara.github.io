      <p>In a world of low-entropy<label for="sn-entropy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-entropy" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I call it low-entropy because everything is so incredibly predictable (any LLM could trivially recreate our timelines). Out of spite for this performative predictability, I aim to write things an LLM wouldn't generate. The compressibility of an idea is a decent proxy for how much impact publishing it will have.</span> slop on LinkedIn, endless takes on X, and fleeting thoughts disappearing down timelines, I want a place to publish concrete ideas. I don't fancy myself a writer or even a thinker of interesting or useful thoughts, but writing is important. The act of writing forces us to formalize our ideas, leading to more precise formulations and mental schemas. So, this place will serve as a sort of mind gym for formalizing whatever ideas I have.</p>

      <p>I'm keeping this site intentionally bare. No engagement metrics, no comment sections, no social features. Just static HTML with some Tufte CSS and a GitHub Pages deployment. I'll mostly write about technical problems that interest me, particularly in systems and functional programming, but also literature, theology, and whatever else catches my attention. Sometimes I'll dump thoughts that are too long to post on X but don't fit neatly into any particular category.</p>

      <p>Nothing here is a final judgement or definitive statement. This is just a place where I work through ideas and write about things I find interesting. I'll post very sparsely and only when I foolishly believe I have something worth saying.</p>
