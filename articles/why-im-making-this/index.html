      <p>The world probably doesn't need another programming blog, and you probably don't need to read one. But I keep finding myself thinking about technical problems or having random observations that feel worth writing down somewhere. So here we are.</p>
      <p>I'm about to graduate and start working on electromagnetic warfare systems at Anduril. The transition from academia to industry feels like a good time to start documenting my thoughts. I'll write about the things that interest me: functional programming, systems, and probably some thoroughly uninteresting musings about whatever's on my mind.</p>
      <p>This site is deliberately minimal. No comments, no analytics, no social features—just plain HTML styled with Tufte CSS and hosted on GitHub Pages. The content will focus on technical deep-dives into problems I find interesting, especially around systems and functional programming. And occasionally, when I have something to say that doesn't fit in a tweet but isn't quite a technical post, it'll end up here too.</p>
      <p>If you're into that sort of thing, stick around. If not, that's fine too—this exists primarily as a place for me to think out loud.</p>
